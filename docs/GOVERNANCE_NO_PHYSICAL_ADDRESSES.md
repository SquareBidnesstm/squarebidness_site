This includes:
- HTML content

- Images (OG, hero, previews)
- Dev/test pages
- Analytics or diagnostic pages

Approved location references are limited to:

Physical addresses are considered **private operational data** and may only be used in:
- Internal documents
- Lender packets
- Legal filings
- Private contracts

Any public deployment containing a physical address is considered a policy violation and must be removed immediately.
