  <h1>Marcus Buckner — Founder of Square Bidness</h1>
  <span class="tag">Principles. Morals. Business Done Right.</span>

  <h2>The Story</h2>
  <p>
    Marcus Buckner is the founder of <strong>Square Bidness Apparel</strong> and the creator of 
    <strong>SB Tech Lab</strong>, a dual-lane brand that blends lifestyle, fashion, 
    construction discipline, and emerging technology from the ground up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Born and raised in Louisiana, Marcus built Square Bidness as a tribute to 
    everyday people who handle business with integrity — no shortcuts, no excuses, 
    and always with pride. From T-shirts to limited-run collections, from recessed 
    lighting installs to data-center prep work, Marcus has shaped Square Bidness 
    into a brand rooted in authenticity, skill, and execution.
  </p>

  <h2>Brand Leader & Builder</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last few years, Marcus expanded the brand from apparel into 
    <strong>multi-site physical infrastructure</strong> including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>HQ1 — Hammond headquarters & production center</li>
    <li>HQ2 — Pineville electrical & field lab</li>
    <li>40×50 slab — future home of SB Tech Lab Phase II</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This hands-on work is the backbone of the <strong>Square Bidness Install Method</strong> — a field philosophy built on precision, consistency, and pride.
  </p>

  <h2>Media Recognition</h2>
  <p>
    Marcus has been featured by <strong>Marquis Who’s Who</strong> and is actively expanding 
    Square Bidness into national visibility, including opportunities with 
    strategist <strong>Heather Villani</strong> and billboard placements.
  </p>

  <h2>What’s Next</h2>
  <p>
    Square Bidness enters 2026 with apparel growth, contractor capability, and 
    a technology roadmap that connects Louisiana communities with future-facing 
    infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong></p>
