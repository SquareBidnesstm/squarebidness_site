<h1>How Square Bidness Learned Electrical Work</h1>
<p class="muted">A real story about discipline, progress, and protecting the brand.</p>

<p>
Square Bidness didn’t hire a crew to build the headquarters. The headquarters was built by hand —  
one outlet, one recessed light, one ceiling line at a time.
</p>

<p>
What started as a fashion brand turned into something bigger: a company that can build its own spaces,
upgrade its own power lanes, correct its own floors, and light its own rooms with clean discipline.
</p>

<h2>Learning Because Nobody Was Going To Do It For Us</h2>
<p>
When HQ1 needed upgrades, no one was pulling up to save the day.  
So the founder learned electrical work — not from YouTube shortcuts, but from measuring, wiring, cutting, checking,
and doing it again until it was right.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Recessed lighting</li>
  <li>Switch banks</li>
  <li>20A safe-load lanes</li>
  <li>Wall repair, priming, and Dover White repaint</li>
  <li>Ceiling fan installation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every improvement at HQ1 and HQ2 became training for the field.  
That’s when the philosophy got a name:
<strong class="gold">The Square Bidness Install Method.</strong>
</p>

<h2>The Method</h2>
<p>
Measure twice.  
Pre-wire on the ground.  
Attic last.  
Plates level.  
No shortcuts.  
No rushed passes.
</p>

<p>
It’s the same discipline used to design apparel — applied to infrastructure.
</p>

<h2>From Apparel Brand to Tech Lab</h2>
<p>
The work that started at HQ1 grew into HQ2 in Pineville, then into Start2Finish contractor work in Alexandria.  
Now it feeds directly into Phase II of the Square Bidness expansion — a 40×50 slab ready for data center modules.
</p>

<p>
Square Bidness Apparel isn’t just a clothing brand anymore.
It’s becoming a company with infrastructure, training, and a method that scales.
</p>

<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>
More lighting.  
Better power lanes.  
Server-ready spaces.  
A modular data center on the slab.  
And more stories from the field as Square Bidness Tech Lab grows.
