          From painting floors in Hammond to touching Vegas, San Francisco, New York, D.C., and Dallas —

        <p class="story-meta">
          January 1, 2026 · By Marcus Buckner
        </p>
      </header>

      <div class="story-body">
        <p>
          The year started fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          I came out of 2024 deep in the infrastructure of HQ — but I wasn’t as hands-on as I am now.
          That changed quick.
        </p>

        <p>
          On January 1, I pulled up to HQ1, met up with an electrician partner, and got some lights back on that had been out.
          As soon as those lights came on, it was on. I ordered LVP, got the flooring delivered, and locked in.
          I covered HQ1 and HQ2, laid down butcher block countertops, and really started treating the space like a true production base —
          not just somewhere I stored boxes.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, I went deeper. I started learning the electrical trade from my amigo and my homeboy Jarvis.
          What began as “let me just get a little more light in here” turned into a whole lot of light —
          recessed lighting everywhere, ceiling fans (72s, 66s, 60s), and upgrades that strengthened the foundation
          for Square Bidness Apparel to actually run the right way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I knew the days of running back and forth without proper infrastructure couldn’t go on forever.
          So I went and put property under Square Bidness. That was the shift:
          from “I got some shirts” to “I own the ground this brand stands on.”
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section-title">Leaving Louisiana, expanding the vision</h2>

        <p>
          For a few years, I hadn’t really left Louisiana. 2025 broke that.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hit Las Vegas, around other fashion designers — listening, soaking up game,
          seeing how people move in different markets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then came San Francisco, and that’s where everything really changed.
          I got introduced to the world of coding and saw how the internet, infrastructure,
          and software actually move money and opportunity. That changed everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, an invite to New York shifted how I saw the world.
          Standing in the fashion capital, I realized: I can hold my own anywhere.
          Louisiana to NYC — I stood on all ten.
        </p>

        <p>
          I made it to D.C. for a world-changing ideas summit and realized I’d been behind on certain things —
          but that was past tense. I caught up quick.
          Those trips showed me it’s not just about selling clothes. It’s about:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Systems.</strong><br>
           <strong>Infrastructure.</strong><br>
           <strong>Values.</strong><br>
           <strong>Mission.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s where 2025 really leveled up.
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section-title">From just apparel to tech &amp; infrastructure</h2>

        <p>
          In 2025, we didn’t just grow Square Bidness Apparel — we created Square Bidness Tech Lab.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I thought was just “sell clothes and keep going” turned into:
        </p>

        <p>
          • Build systems that can scale.<br>
          • Build infrastructure that can power more than just one brand.<br>
          • Use tech to support real people and local businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started treating the brand like a full ecosystem — apparel, content, checkout, tools,
          and future data/AI lanes — not just a T-shirt line.
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section-title">Touching Dallas, media, and rollouts</h2>

        <p>
          I shot over to Dallas for the Impressions Expo, staying close to the print, decoration,
          and garment game. That’s part of being a real operator — understanding the tools behind the visuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also did my first podcast with Terrance “Gangsta” Williams.
          That wasn’t just content — it was a rollout move to bring awareness to the brand and the website I built myself.
          It was promotion, storytelling, and proof of work all in one lane.
        </p>

        <p>
          All throughout 2025, I kept working, kept grinding, kept selling, and kept scaling.
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section-title">Process, principles, and 2026</h2>

        <p>
          One thing I know for sure: There is a process to all of this. God first.
          You cannot cheat the process. You can’t skip the line if you want what you’re building to last.
        </p>

        <p>
          People see someone else doing something and think, “I can do that too.”
          Then when they don’t get the same results, they start asking, “Why him? I can do that.”
        </p>

        <p>
          But here’s what I learned: perfect something first.
          Lock in on one lane, build it solid, then move over.
          If you skip that, you don’t just get in somebody else’s way — you get in your own way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I caught a slogan at the Paper Planes store that stuck with me:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Greatness is a process.</strong></p>

        <p>
          That’s exactly how this feels.
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section-title">Four years in — still in motion</h2>

        <p>
          Square Bidness was founded in January 2022.
          Four years later, we’re still at the top of our game — not because it was easy,
          but because we stayed in motion:
        </p>

        <p>
          • Building HQ infrastructure.<br>
          • Owning property in the brand’s name.<br>
          • Traveling and learning from Vegas, San Francisco, New York, D.C., and Dallas.<br>
          • Launching Square Bidness Tech Lab.<br>
          • Stepping into media, storytelling, and digital systems.<br>
          • Getting invited inside banks, talking funding, and deciding who we want to partner with.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now it’s 2026 — and we’re here to stay.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re building a team. We’re creating jobs. We’re getting welcomed into rooms we used to only dream about —
          and we’re walking in as Square Bidness, not just asking for a seat, but bringing value to the table.
        </p>

        <p>
          So get ready.
        </p>

        <p>
          2026, we scaling and saling — standing on the foundation I built four years ago.
          Get with it, not without it. <strong>Square Bidness.</strong>
