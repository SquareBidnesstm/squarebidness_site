        Four days in New York City at one of the biggest innovation conferences in the country. Here's what I learned about taking Square Bidness to the next level.

    <article class="blog-body">
      <p>I just wrapped up Innovation Fest 2025 in NYC, and I’m still processing everything that happened. Coming from Louisiana, meeting tech leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators from around the world — it was my first time in NYC and in a setting like this, and know what, I felt right at home.</p>

      <h2>Why Innovation Fest Mattered</h2>
      <p>When I first heard about Innovation Fest, I knew Square Bidness needed to be there. We’re not just building a clothing brand — we’re building a movement rooted in principles, morals, and business done right.</p>
      <p>The conference brought together people who are changing industries, disrupting norms, and building for the future. That’s exactly where Square Bidness belongs.</p>

      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

      <h3>Representation Matters</h3>
      <p>Walking into rooms where you’re often the only person who looks like you, comes from where you come from, or represents what you represent — it’s powerful and necessary. Square Bidness isn’t just about apparel. It’s about showing that Louisiana has innovators, that veterans can build businesses, that principles can drive profit.</p>

      <h3>The Power of Authentic Networking</h3>
      <p>I met founders, investors, and industry leaders who were genuinely interested in our story. Not because we had the flashiest deck, but because our mission resonated. When you’re building something real, people feel it.</p>

      <blockquote>“Principles. Morals. Business Done Right.” That’s not just our tagline — it’s how we showed up in every conversation.</blockquote>

      <h3>What’s Next for Square Bidness</h3>
      <p>The connections made at Innovation Fest are already opening doors. We’re exploring partnerships that could take our distribution national, investors who understand our vision, and mentors who’ve walked similar paths.</p>
      <p>The experience also reinforced that we’re on the right track. The VSOP Collection timing couldn’t be better. The market is ready for brands that stand for something deeper than just products.</p>

      <h2>Louisiana to the World</h2>
      <p>People were fascinated by our Louisiana roots. In a world of generic brands and copycat strategies, authenticity cuts through. Veteran-owned, Louisiana-based, principle-driven — that’s not something you can manufacture.</p>

      <h2>The VSOP Connection</h2>
      <p>While at the conference, I made it to Moët Hennessy’s offices. <strong>Standing there in VSOP-inspired pieces, next to the Moët Hennessy sign in the World Trade Center, around the 50th floor</strong>, it hit me — this is what the collection represents. Very Superior. Original Principles. Not just in cognac, but in business, in life, in how we show up.</p>

      <p>That moment validated what we’re building with the VSOP Collection. It’s not just apparel — it’s a statement about excellence, authenticity, and staying true to your values while reaching high.</p>

      <h2>What Innovation Really Means</h2>
      <p>Innovation isn’t only about tech or disruption. Sometimes it’s taking timeless principles and applying them in new ways. We innovate by prioritizing values in an industry that often doesn’t. We innovate by being authentic in a space full of manufactured personas.</p>

      <p>Back in Louisiana now, but the energy from NYC is driving everything we do next. This is just the beginning — see you on the VSOP page.</p>
